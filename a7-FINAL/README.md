**1.** The purpose of this project is to showcase my work over the course of this quarter, the development of my web development skills, and the extent of my coding skills at present.

**2.** This project can be found on my GitHub [here](

**3.** I spent a lot of time rereading the learning modules, the React documentation, and the exercises we did in class to get the hang of writing this. StackOverflow also saved my life on multiple occasions. 

**4.** It took me approximately 20 hours to do this challenge.

**5.** I had some really weird problems with reading in data through jQuery -- although I tried to get the data.json file, it kept returning my index.html file instead. This happened with Assignment 6 as well; not sure why it happens, but providing students with a heads up about this weird bug would probably be handy.
