After I graduate from UW, I hope to go into video game design, using the skills I have acquired here in the iSchool to create video games that represent a diverse array of characters in a unique, thoughtful, and respectful way. Outside of Informatics, I am also involved in the <a href=\"http://students.washington.edu/fasa/\">Filipino American Student Association</a> here at UW, where I serve as secretary. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching musicals, playing the flute, and dancing.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default AboutPage;\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/About.js\n **/","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './css/App.css';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router';\nimport '../node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"App\">\n            <div className=\"header\"></div>\n            <div className=\"navbar\">\n                <Link className=\"link\" activeClassName='active' to=\"/\"><i className=\"fa fa-home\"></i></Link> \n                <Link className=\"link\" activeClassName='active' to=\"/projects\">Projects</Link> \n                <Link className=\"link\" activeClassName='active' to=\"/about\">About</Link>\n                <Link className=\"link\" activeClassName='active' to=\"/contact\">Contact</Link>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"children\">\n                {this.props.children}\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"footer\">\n                <p>&copy; Saralyn Santos, Autumn 2016</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/App.js\n **/","import React from 'react';\r\nimport './css/Contact.css';\r\nimport '../node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css';\r\nimport linkedin from './img/linkedin.png';\r\nimport email from './img/email.png';\r\n\r\nvar Contact = React.createClass({\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<div className=\"container\">\r\n                <h1>Contact Me</h1>\r\n                <p>If you would like to get in contact with me, please leave a message below and I'll get back to you!</p>\r\n                <div className=\"row\">\r\n                    <form className=\"col s12\">\r\n                      <div className=\"row\">\r\n                        <div className=\"input-field col s12\">\r\n                          <textarea id=\"textarea1\" className=\"materialize-textarea\"></textarea>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                    </form>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n                <p>In addition, you can get in touch with me via the following locations:</p>   \r\n                <div className=\"row links\">\r\n                    <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/saralynsantos\"><img src={linkedin} alt=\"LinkedIn logo\" /></a>\r\n                    <a href=\"mailto:saralyns@uw.edu\"><img src={email} alt=\"email logo\" height=\"108\"/></a>\r\n                </div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default Contact;\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./src/Contact.js\n **/","import React from 'react';\r\nimport './css/HomePage.css';\r\n\r\nvar HomePage = React.createClass({\r\n    render() {\r\n        return(\r\n            <div className=\"container home\">\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <h2>INFO 343 C Portfolio</h2>\r\n                    <h3>Saralyn Santos, Autumn 2016</h3>\r\n                    <div>Welcome to my portfolio!
